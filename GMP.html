    This page is for the website I created for the Discord server "Gang Members". 
    I am one of the administrators in this server where we like to play games 
    and hang out.
</p>
<p>
    The server started out with just 5 people where we played CS:GO, later on
    we branched out to other games.
</p>
<p>
    Eventually we grew close enough through the games we played to hang out in 
    real life aswell, we hosted barbecues and went to gaming related events.
