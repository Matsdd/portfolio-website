    Programming
  </section>
  <section class="subtitle">
    During my time at CMGT I have come in contact with many programming languages 
    like Javascript, PHP and C#. Javascript and PHP also in the form of frameworks 
    like Node and Laravel.
  </section>
  <section class="subtitle">
    I continue to use Javascript with Node, express and sometimes react to create 
    other web-based applications that can be seen in my Projects tab. I also have 
    experience with the ExcalliburJS engine, which is a game engine made with 
    JavaScript for in your browser.
  </section>
  <section class="subtitle">
    I also use C# in combination with Unity to create games. Many of my game projects 
    are serious games made for my studies. Information on these can also be found in my 
    Projects tab.

  </section>
  <section class="subtitle">
    Bein born in the Netherlands, I am a native dutch speaker. It being closely related 
    to the German language I have been practicing that to be able to speak it aswell, I 
    am no where near fluent yet though.

    Like most people, i also speak english due to my online presence. Unlike most people 
    though, I have taken multiple cambridge certificate exams. I have done a First 
    certificate in English exam (or FCE) in June of 2019. In which a achieved a Grade A and 
    scored 183 out of 190 points. Then I did the Certificate of Profeciency in English exam 
    (or CPE) in March of 2022. In which I achieved a grade B, which equates to a C2 council 
    of europe level.
